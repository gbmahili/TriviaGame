                <p>This trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out. If the player selects the correct
                answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option shows up. <br>
                After a few seconds, the next question displays without user input. <br><br>
                The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the player runs out of time, the player is informed that time's up and the correct answer is displayed, wait a few
                        seconds, then the next question shows up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is informed that they selected the wrong option and then the correct
                        answer is displayed, wait a few seconds, then the next question shows up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    On the final screen, the number of correct answers is displayed, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without
                    reloading the page).
