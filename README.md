# TriviaGame

This trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option shows up. After a few seconds, the next question displays without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, the player is informed that time's up and the correct answer is displayed, wait a few seconds, then the next question shows up.
* If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is informed that they selected the wrong option and then the correct answer is displayed, wait a few seconds, then the next question shows up.

On the final screen, the number of correct answers is displayed, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
